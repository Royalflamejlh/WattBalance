- Voltage input into ADC must be less thatn 3.3v (vcc), in the nist paper they ranged from -200mV to 200mV so we should be good, but need to add over voltage protection, along with voltage shift so it is initially ~1.65v (to read negative induced voltage)

- Add MOSFET controlled by a PWM from atmega to control the current through the coil, along with connect the current sensor to it to provide feedback

- Current supply needs to be bipolar, also need to be able to read bipolar current?

- Find values for the TVS

- Find values for the Oscillators

- Ensure USB schematic is correct
