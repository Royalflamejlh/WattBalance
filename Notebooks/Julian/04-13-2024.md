# Working on PCB Layout V2

- corrected footprint for the oscillators, only one now
- H bridge was added to schematic, found footprint
- Added more footprints for molex connectors for coils and voltage checking
- Placed footprints for GPIO headers, OPAMP, DAC, LEDs
- Changed Hall effect sensor footprint to ISP connector because it's similar
