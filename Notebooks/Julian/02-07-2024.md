# Watt Balance

- measures mass of an object using constants instead of comparing against a known weight
- 2 modes, force and velocity
- force mode measures current
- velocity mode measures voltage and velocity

## Current Grad Team Watt Balance

- 20-30% accuracy
- takes a while to calculate mass
- using arduino and external power supply
- ultrasonic sensor for position
- controlled with matlab
- grad team has the balance move the coils, told us we should move the magnets instead

## Key Objectives

- Custom software to control the watt balance
  - communication between computer and balance
  - calculations done on microcontroller, calibration done with software
  - simple display on balance to show calculated mass
- Custom pcb
  - Microcontroller
  - USB connection to computer
  - Drive coils, calculate mass
  - PID system to balance the scale
- Physical Balance
  - 3D-Print instead of LEGO
  - Replace ultrasonic sensor and fulcrum with Hall effect sensor and axle and bearing
