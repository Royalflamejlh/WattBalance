# Soldering Day 2

- Discovered missing grounding on USB-UART chip, had to add jumper wires
  - This resulted in us shorting the board, luckily we had a fuse to protect the components
  - We figured out it was the issue when we pushed 3Amps through the board and fried the chip
  - plan to get new UART chip tomorrow from ECE Parts shop
