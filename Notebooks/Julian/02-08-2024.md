# Planning the watt balance

## Subsystems

### Power

- DC to AC convertor for coils
- Power the pcb

### Measurement

- Calculations done on pcb
- control loop/ calibration
- Ammeter for coil current, Hall effect sensor for rotation

### Mechanical

- Hall effect sensor with an axle should have little friction
- electronic shielding?

### IO/Data

- communicate with computer if connected
- use to calibrate or change settings
- calculate velocity from change in angle
- use voltage and velocity to get coil constant
- use current and coil constant to get mass

## Equations

- Force mode

$F = ma = BLI$

- Velocity mode

$V = BLv$
